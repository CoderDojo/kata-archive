## Summary

 [Ninjas](Ninjas.md) create a felt badge that
lights up.

Participants are not restricted to making badges - other ideas could be
masks, bracelets, headbands, a simple patch, felt animals/characters or
anything else you can think of. The project could even be implemented
directly into items of old clothing. Possibilities for a collaborative
project include a blanket or throw, curtain, wall hanging, tablecloth,
cushion cover, etc.



## What's Covered

  - Introduction to circuit components and concepts of + and -
  - Making a simple LED circuit
  - How a switch works and how to use one in a circuit
  - Using conductive thread and sewable components to make a wearable
    circuit
  - Basic sewing skills
  - Adding multiple LEDs to a circuit
  - How to make a wearable circuit that’s split into detachable
    components

## Materials Required

The expected cost for a group of 10 participants is approx €50 (excl
online delivery charges). Note that the battery holders (approx €2 each)
contribute significantly to the cost per child. It is possible for
Ninjas to collaborate on a group project that requires only one battery
& battery holder - see the last card in the series for how to modify the
basic wearable circuit to allow this.

  - CR2032 3V coin cell batteries
  - Sewable CR2032 coin cell battery holders
  - Conductive thread
  - Regular LEDs
  - Optional: sewable LEDs
  - Optional: sewable switches
  - Craft felt (or any available fabric e.g. cutoffs/scraps, old
    clothes, etc)
  - Embroidery needles
  - Scissors
  - Badge pins/safety pins
  - Embroidery thread/plain cotton thread and/or glue

Additional materials that may be useful:

  - Needle threader - strongly recommended as the conductive thread
    frays very easily
  - Elastic (for making headbands/bracelets/etc as an alternative to
    badges)
  - Crocodile clips
  - Round-nosed pliers
  - Electrical tape or masking tape
