## Tips for use

1.   Copy eightball.html, example.html, the images folder, the css
    folder and the javascript folder from the
    [files](https://drive.google.com/a/coderdojo.com/file/d/0B3fF-SL4F7i7WDAwQWNqWkhBOTg/view?usp=sharing)
    to the learner's machine before using the cards.
2.   You can also copy the worksheet folder. This contains the
    [PDF](PDF.md) format Sushi Cards.
3.   It's a good idea to ensure that file extensions are visible on the
    target computer.
4.   Ensure that the learner's computer has a text editor installed (we
    recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)). Then give the learner Card 1.
5.   Be aware that when a learner is attempting one of the "fun
    exercises" (in a yellow box on some of the cards) they may need help
    in completing it.
