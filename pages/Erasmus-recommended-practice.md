\_\_NOTOC\_\_ The Recommended Practice is a set of guiding principles
that Dojos can choose to meet. Styled in the ‘Sushi Card’ format, these
guiding principles are to serve as a guide for new and existing Dojos
wishing to meet best practice standards. On the other hand, a
Recommended Practice is a method or technique that has consistently
shown results superior to those achieved by other means.

## Recommended Practice

A selection of recommended practices that are curated and available here
in Sushi Card format for you to use at your Dojo. We have organised them
into [Paths](Path.md) that allow your Dojo to follow through a
particular series of recommended practices, a particular topic
moving.
