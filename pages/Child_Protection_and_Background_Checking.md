### Child Protection

Background checking is just one part of a Dojos Child Protection Plan
but can be useful when recruiting new volunteers and ensuring they are
safe to work with children\!

Many countries have different procedures for background checking, if
your country is on the list below please see if we have any existing
tips or partnerships to help. If your region is not included below,
please research this and get in touch **(info@coderdojo.com )** if you
have any tips to share with other volunteers in your area.

As all Dojos are free of charge for attendees [(in accordance with the
CoderDojo Charter of Ethics)](https://zen.coderdojo.com/charter) and all
volunteers are unpaid it is understandable that there are limited
resources available. If background checking is costly in your region we
recommend reaching out to an organisation in your area who may be
interested in supporting the cost of background checking for your Dojo's
volunteers.

Both if you can or cannot background check your mentors please ensure
you take other steps to recruit volunteers safely such as by asking for
and checking non-family referees.  

### Background checking

Creating a safe environment is one of the key aspects of running and
maintaining an awesome Dojo. Considering how to safeguard the young
people in your Dojo is a crucial element of creating that safe
environment. While legislation and expectations can vary from country to
country, there are some best practice measures a Dojo can take such as
safe recruitment of volunteers and setting a code of good practice for
volunteers which will safeguard young people from harm.

If you have knowledge on Best Practice and/or Child Protection
legislation in your region and have created documents which would be of
use to other Dojos in your area which is not covered below, please let
us know on
**info@coderdojo.com**.
