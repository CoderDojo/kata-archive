"Unverified_dojo_alert.png")

Dojos that have no been verified by the core CoderDojo team, have this
alert on their Dojo listing on Zen. Usually, this is at the early
'planning' stages of a Dojo, prior to a first session. In addition to
this, this Dojo does not appear in the main Dojo list on Zen, until it
is verified. The listing still exists and is public however, so you can
still share the URL.

The team do routine checks on unverified Dojo listings and verify those
they feel are ready. If you want to be proactive, contact the team by
email <startup@coderdojo.com> or twitter
[@CoderDojo](http://twitter.com/coderdojo) and take it from there.
