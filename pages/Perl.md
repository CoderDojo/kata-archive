Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic
programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and
Perl 6.

Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms
in use, such as: Practical Extraction and Reporting Language.\] Perl was
originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix
scripting language to make report processing easier.\[7\] Since then, it
has undergone many changes and revisions. The latest major stable
revision of Perl 5 is 5.18, released in May 2013. Perl 6, which began as
a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate
language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by
different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.

Perl 5 is the current "default Perl" found on most Linux and UNIX
distributions and it's a highly useful and flexible language.

Perl 6 is a completely crafted re-thought of the whole language.
