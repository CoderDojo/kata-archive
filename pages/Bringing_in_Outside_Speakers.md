## Problem

Outside speakers can be great for bringing real-world relevance into the
dojo, and new interesting content. Finding them and making it fit in
with the dojo can be harder. The level of talk may not be suitable for
all kids at the dojo.

## Possible Solutions

  - Do an exercise related to the talk in the dojo.

## Actual Experience

Science Gallery CoderDojo has had talks on software security followed in
the advanced room with a video of what goes on at a hacker conference;
Also a talk on protein database searching, followed for the pythonistas
by an exercise on 'string matching'.
