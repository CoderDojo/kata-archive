CoderDojo is using badges as a way to give recognition to attendees of
Dojos who have achieved great things. These Digital badges allow you to
verify the skills, interests and achievements of you Dojo community. A
badge has core criteria to be met before being awarded by a
[Champion](Champion.md) to other
CoderDojo members, usually \[Ninjas\] (though there are some badges for
adults too\!)

You can find the [list of badges](https://zen.coderdojo.com/badges) on
the CoderDojo website and watch [a video showing you how to award
badges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPKXszTwkDE) on YouTube.
