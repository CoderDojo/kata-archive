## Summary

 [Ninjas](Ninjas.md) decorate a t-shirt with
coloured flashing lights controlled by code. 

## What's Covered

  - Testing NeoPixels
  - Stitching a NeoPixel circuit with positive, negative and data flow
  - The flow of a Flora program (setup and loop functions)
  - Turning NeoPixels on and off
  - Addressing individual NeoPixels
  - RGB colour mixing
  - Functions and parameters
  - for loops
  - Exploring more advanced examples

## Materials Required

  - Adafruit Flora or Gemma and a USB cable
  - Around eight NeoPixels
  - Conductive thread
  - Three pairs of crocodile clips (you could use pieces of conductive
    thread instead but crocodile clips are easier to test with)
  - Optional: a battery pack to make the project portable
  - Embroidery needle and scissors
  - T-shirt or other fabric
  - Embroidery hoop - strongly recommended as it makes stitching much
    easier
  - Recommended: clear nail polish

### Expected cost

Prices vary depending on what you buy and where you buy it from but you
can expect to pay approximately â‚¬30-50 for the hardware for one project
(excl online delivery charges). The Gemma is much smaller and cheaper
than the Flora but is not as widely compatible. It also may be cheaper
to buy parts separately or in a kit. Advice: shop around\!
