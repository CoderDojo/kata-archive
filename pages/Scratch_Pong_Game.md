## Summary

 Create the classic computer game in Scratch. Move your
paddle to bounce the ball and keep it in play, like a game of tennis.
The aim is to try and bounce the ball past the other player's paddle\!


## Tips for use

You will need to either install Scratch on the
[Ninja](Ninja.md)'s machine or use the [web-based
editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/) in advance of using these cards.

There are two different resources you can try, a two player game or a
one-player game against the computer.
