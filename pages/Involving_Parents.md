## Problem

Parents are required to be there, but then may be sitting around doing
nothing.

## Possible Solutions

  - Plan out what you want from parents. Particularly with the very
    youngest kids, sitting with the kids is important.

## Actual Experience

At Science Gallery there has been a drop off in the number of parents
accompanying the kids. What happens quite a bit now is one parent
bringing their kids and friends kids too. The arrangement of the room
matters. On some occasions we've had soft bench seating round the edge
of the room, and on those occasions we have more parents present in the
room, on the seating near their kids table.

At UCD CoderDojo we have space for parents to sit with their kids at
their table. The parents are picking up more there about coding than at
Science Gallery.
