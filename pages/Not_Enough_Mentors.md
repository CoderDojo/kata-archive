## Problem

After the initial enthusiasm of a newly set up Dojo, mentor availability
drops off.

## Possible Solutions

  - Make sure there is an abundance of mentors when first starting out,
    so mentors don't have to come to every session for the dojo to work.
  - Shut down the dojo during summer or run it less frequently.
  - Have more for the mentors - for example competitions that the kids
    take part in and visitors giving talks can both be of interest to
    mentors.
  - Ask mentors if they know other people who would make good mentors so
    as to increase the pool of mentors.

## Actual Experience

At Science Gallery CoderDojo bringing in outside speakers has somewhat
reduced the need for mentors - more happens in the lecture theater.

At UCD CoderDojo the dojo shuts down over the summer. There was a
particular dip in mentors near the exam time for graduate students who
were acting as mentors.
