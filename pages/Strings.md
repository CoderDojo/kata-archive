Strings are letters and words tie together for humans to read, this
means the computer ignores the content and usuually just prints (echoed)
them to the screen. Strings are usually set between quotes or double
quotes.

`$player_1_name = "Techbot"; `

`if $player_score >10 `  
`{`  
`      echo "Congratulations" . $player_1_name . " You've won";`  
`}`
