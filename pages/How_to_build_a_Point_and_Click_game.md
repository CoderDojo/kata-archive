\-- A development project by Simon Champion.

in the vein of Monkey Island, but running in a browser.

Includes a game designer and a game playing engine.

This project is very much a work-in-progress at the moment. Large parts
of the intended functionality is still incomplete. Right now it should
be seen more at a proof-of-concept than a finished system.
