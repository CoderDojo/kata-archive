## Summary

 Program an Arduino to tell you when your plant needs
watering. 

## Tips for use

The following hardware is required for this project:

  - An Arduino Uno (or likewise)
  - A moisture sensor
  - An A2D converter (comes with most moisture sensors)
  - Three jumper leads (for Arduino)

In this tutorial you will program the Arduino to detect different levels
of moisture and make the LED flash accordingly.

The original web version of the tutorial can be viewed
[here.](https://yorkdojo.github.io/worksheets/arduino/plant-moisture-tweeter/)

There is also a link at the end to a [Raspberry Pi Learning
Resource](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api/worksheet/)
that shows you how to connect your program to Twitter so it can "tweet"
updates about the moisture levels\!
