## Summary

 [Ninjas](Ninjas.md) learn to build their first web
pages, including headings, links, images, tables and formatting.


## Tips for use

These cards were designed for use with [Trinket](https://trinket.io/),
an online code editing platform. It is recommended to sign up for a free
account but it is not required to be able to follow along. If preferred,
Ninjas may follow along using a plain text editor and local files on
their computer instead, with help from a mentor. The sample projects can
be downloaded from Trinket without having to sign in. It's a good idea
to ensure that file extensions are visible on the target computer.

## Content

The Sushi Cards are in a web based format and can be read online
(recommended) at the link below. [Read the Sushi Cards\! ](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-beginner-html-css-sushi)

There is also an option to print them as a PDF if required.

Also available in

## Mentor Tips

A number of example projects are available for Mentors to help guide
Ninjas if they are stuck on a particular Sushi Card. These are listed in
[this
document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13XBYhOuiTi0oaFyWVx6BGAxl2EgKayvaDvtdh_-HL2c)
There is a separate Trinket project for each Sushi Card, as well as a
"finished product" that shows what the website might look like after
completing the whole set of Sushi Cards.
