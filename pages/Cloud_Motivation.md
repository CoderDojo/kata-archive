## Summary

 Why cloud mentoring? 

## Content

As CoderDojo has continued to grow and expand globally, it has
encountered instances where there are champions interested in
establishing dojos, but unable to find enough mentors.

In some cases, champions with limited local support can start running
dojos, but can only take their ninjas so far before requiring the help
of mentors in specific technologies that their ninjas want to explore.

At the same time, there are people with technical knowledge who may not
be able to volunteer with their local dojos, or that simply have some
time in their hands and want to help a remote dojo that most likely will
fail without their support.

        What if we could create a system to allow such champions and
        mentors to connect?
        What if, once this connection has been made, we could leverage
        remote collaboration tools to facilitate the interaction between
        ninjas in dojos in remote locations and these mentors “in the
        cloud”?

Putting our heads together to answer these questions, the Cloud Mentor
initiative was born. This model has been informally piloted since 2012
through volunteers that intuited its value, but it was not until
February of 2015 that it was officially adopted by the CoderDojo
Foundation. The Foundation is now formally incorporating the initiative
under its scope, with aims to deploy it in a limited scale in
mid-October 2015.
