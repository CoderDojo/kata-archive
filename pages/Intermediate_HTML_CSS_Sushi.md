## Summary

 Improve your exisiting web pages by making them responsive
using [CSS](CSS.md). 

## Tips for use

These cards were designed for use with [Trinket](https://trinket.io/),
an online code editing platform. It is recommended to sign up for a free
account but it is not required to be able to follow along. If preferred,
Ninjas may follow along using a plain text editor and local files on
their computer instead, with help from a mentor. The sample projects can
be downloaded from Trinket without having to sign in. It's a good idea
to ensure that file extensions are visible on the target computer.

## Content

The Sushi Cards are in a web based format and can be read online

There is also an option to print them as a PDF if required.

## Mentor Tips

A number of example projects are available for Mentors to help guide
Ninjas if they are stuck on a particular Sushi Card. These are listed in
[this
document.](https://docs.google.com/a/codeclub.org.uk/document/d/1rdRIGa-oPymK_4Ysz-Yjhdwam8NoKg3bkVbIHZqe1AA/edit?usp=sharing)
There is a separate Trinket project for each Sushi Card.
