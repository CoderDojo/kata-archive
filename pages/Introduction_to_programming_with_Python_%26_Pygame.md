  - If you are planning to attend the Python stream,

<!-- end list -->

  - Please download all the content from <http://goo.gl/SED5Od> for the
    course into a ‘C:\\Python\_Course’ folder on your C: drive.

## Installing:

  - How To videos are available at <http://inventwithpython.com/videos/>
    if you need them. You shouldn’t, hopefully.

<!-- end list -->

  - From your new folder -\> C:\\Python\_Course\\Install

Install - python-3.3.1 first. – Be sure to install to a C:\\Python33
folder during the install. You should be given the option in the
install.

  - Install - pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py3.3.1 – second. Pygame should find
    the python 3.3.1 install ‘automagically’ if you don’t change
    anything. It may refer to a reg, or registry entry. Accept it. If
    you don’t get this, don’t panic\! We can catch up in the Dojo.
    Though we hope it should ‘just work’.

  - eBook "Invent your own computer games with Python" - download the
    PDF from <http://inventwithpython.com/IYOCGwP_book1.pdf>

<!-- end list -->

  - Note for Mac users – you WILL have problems getting Pygame to work
    with the Mac version of Python. The only way we have gotten this to
    work is to use the bootcamp feature of Mac. Essentially running
    Windows version under MAC OS to get reliable results.

Please ensure that you know where the Python folder is located (put a
shortcut on the Desktop) and put all relevant files in that folder.

  - If for any reason the Python IDLE GUI does not install, please
    download and install Notepad++ or similar text editor (DO NOT use MS
    Notepad). You can then type and save your programmes (make sure you
    use a .py extension). Or ask a Mentor.

Given the above instructions ‘stuff’ should just work. If not, a Mentor
is your best bet.
