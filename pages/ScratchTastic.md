**What is Scratch?** ![Scratch\_cat\_large.png](../files/img/Scratch_cat_large.png
"Scratch_cat_large.png")

:\*Scratch is a programming language and an online community where young
people can program and share interactive media such as stories, games,
and animation with people from all over the world. With Scratch, you can
program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share
your creations with others in the online community.

:\*As children create with Scratch, they learn to think creatively, work
collaboratively, and reason systematically — essential skills for life
in the 21st century.

:\*Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT
Media Lab. It is provided free of charge.

[You can try Scratch HERE\! ](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted)

:\*You can find the **ScratchEd handbook** to learning Scratch for
**free download
[HERE\!](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/index.html)**The guide
can be used in a variety of settings (classrooms, clubs, museums,
libraries, and more) with a variety of learners (K-12, college, and
beyond). No prior experience with computer programming is required, only
a sense of adventure\!

:\*You can find some more Scratch resources in the
[ScratchTastic](ScratchTastic.md) Kata section.

:\*Most Dojos usually run a beginners Scratch session at first and then
develop their topics based on the skills of the mentors and the
preferred projects of the young people attending. Dojos will usually
then move on to HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, MINECRAFT modding,
Raspberry Pis etc.

:\*You can take the edX 'Programming in Scratch' course for free
[HERE\!](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-scratch-harveymuddx-cs002x#.VMYSsfmsWJG)
**You can either choose to pay and get accredited for this course or to
'Audit' it and take it at no cost.**
