## Summary

 How to make the background of your game move across the
screen, to give the impression that your sprites are moving quickly even
though they are remaining at the same “X” position on the screen.


## Tips for use

You will need to either install Scratch on the
[Ninja](Ninja.md)'s machine or use the [web-based
editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/) in advance of using these cards.
