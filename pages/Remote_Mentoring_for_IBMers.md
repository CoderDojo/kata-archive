Currently only IBMers can sign up as remote mentors.

  - **Flexibility**

:\*You can contribute / Mentor whenever you have time, with whatever
skills and knowledge you have.

  - **It's Easy**

:\*You do not need to be 'super-knowledgable' in a specific technology
to remote Mentor. Most of the time you will be instructing young people
in the first steps / lines of code in a language or technology of your
choice, you do not need to be a guru to make this happen\!Once you share
your knowledge on how to take this first step, you will be empowering
them with the skills to create cool projects all by themselves.

  - **Translation**

:\*As Remote Mentoring aims to reach out to every corner of the globe,
we are looking for help in translating CoderDojo related learning
materials\! You can help if you know English and one other language.

  - **Share your Knowledge**

:\*Whatever your skill set is, whatever your experience is - if you are
interested in enabling free IT education for young people world-wide as
a remote mentor for CoderDojo -

# Becoming a Remote Mentor at CoderDojo

This section will tell you more about how you can play your part in
enabling free IT education for young people world-wide, as a remote
mentor.

**Mentoring Tips - Remotely or Locally**

  - CoderDojo focuses on peer-to-peer and self lead learning and in an
    informal and social education environment. It is very different from
    formal education structures, there is no curriculum, no expectations
    and no grades. Mentors are there to inspire and empower young people
    to develop their problem solving skills and learn to find answers
    for themselves.

<!-- end list -->

  - A Mentor is not expected to have all the answers and in some cases
    Mentors end up mentoring young people in technologies that are just
    as new to them as they are to the pupil. At a Dojo a Mentor is there
    to help CoderDojo youth to build their problem solving skills and to
    show appreciation of the young persons progress empowering them with
    the drive to learn. This kind of environment encourages young
    peoples curiosity and creativity with technology at their Dojo.

<!-- end list -->

  - If you are worried that your technical skills are not enough to
    Mentor a young person - don't. Sometimes it is even better not to
    have all the answers, in this case you can help young people to find
    these answers on their own. This can be more beneficial for young
    people learning, than giving them the answer removing the process of
    questioning, searching and evaluating new information.

<!-- end list -->

  - When asked a question you do not know answer for - admit it, and
    suggest to find answer together. Then Mentor them via the process of
    finding the answer online for themselves.

<!-- end list -->

  - You can explain that there is not much point to learning all
    language syntaxes by heart - they are always available online,
    besides, all IT knowledge is evolving all the time, and today
    popular technologies are quickly replaced by others. Hence, once you
    practice enough how to problem solve, and once you gain confidence
    in taking on board new, unfamiliar to you technology - you will be
    capable to program anything, using any language.

**Problem Solving**

  - Problem solving is the truly valuable skill, you can mention this to
    young people every time you are unable to answer their question.
    When you know the answer to the question - do not give it away,
    instead try to help them find it by themselves. Explaining the
    importance of problem solving as a skill. If they spent a good
    amount of time searching and did not find it - at least they
    practised a problem solving exercise\! In this case then give them
    an answer rewarding their hard work and patience.

**Role Models**

  - Young people are great at figuring out problems for themselves and
    if your Dojo has Mentors that are regarded as role models, Mentors
    who spend time to time asking youth attendees what they're up to and
    who positively reinforce their efforts â€“ you will see amazing
    creativity and progress in the knowledge and skill of the young
    people attending your Dojo\! This is displayed annually at the
    [Coolest Projects Event.](http://coolestprojects.org/)

<!-- end list -->

  - As for questions from kids - many times they will be repetitive, and
    you need to remember that CoderDojo heavily encourages peer
    learning, hence once you explain one child how to do something, you
    should forward all other kids with the same question to this child.
    It will generate a lot of positive collaboration among the kids
    locally and help them make friends, build their social and
    team-collaboration skills.

**Sugata Mitra on Remote Mentoring**

  - Sugata Mitra had tested this technique within child-driven learning
    environment in India - by mounting a PC into the wall (literally)
    and allowing young people using it freely, while Remote Mentors were
    interacting with young people to help them out on their learning
    journey. This is a 'how to' and 'why to' intro for every person who
    wants to be successful Remote Mentor, it is also an awesome talk, so
    check it out below:
