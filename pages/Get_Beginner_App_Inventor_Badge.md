## Getting your badge

You can now ask a Mentor to help you claim your Beginner App Inventor
Badge. They will need to follow these instructions:

1.  You will need to have each of the following set up:
      - Ensure you have Badge Admin permissions (Champions always have
        them and can grant them to Mentors from the **Manage Dojo**
        page)
      - Ensure that the Ninja has an account on coderdojo.com and is a
        member of your Dojo
2.  Go to the **Manage Users** page for your Dojo
3.  Select the Ninja's profile
4.  In the bar that appears at the bottom of the screen, choose **Award
    Badge**
5.  Select **App Inventor \[Beginner\]** and award it\!
