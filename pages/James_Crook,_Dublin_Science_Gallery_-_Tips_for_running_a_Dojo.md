  - **Keep it fun**.

        Mentors give up their precious Saturdays for free because they
        enjoy it. So make it fun for the mentors. If they are enjoying
        it, they'll come back, and the children will enjoy the dojo too.

  - **Inspire, don't lecture**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        A 'standard prepared lesson' is hard work to prepare, and does
        not work. The children are all at different levels. No single
        lesson fits all. Technical mentors tend to overload the children
        when they lecture. I've seen a mentor deliver HTML + CSS +
        Javascript + cross-browser-compatability + particle physics to a
        class that were still figuring out how to use cut and paste on
        the text editor. The only children who 'did well' were the ones
        who copied verbatim what was up on the projector. Wasn't fun.
        Wasn't much useful learning. Using a complex example and
        focusing in on one aspect can work well.

  - **Plenty of Mentors**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        It is so much easier when there are plenty of mentors. It
        reduces stress on each mentor. There's time to chat with other
        mentors and see what is really going on. You should feel the
        dojo will go on running just fine, if you are away from it for a
        couple of weekends.

  - **Reduce the need for Adult mentors**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Get children asking each other questions and working in teams.
        Encourage them to mentor. Show children doing HTML w3schools so
        that they can start teaching themselves. Explain to them that
        they will learn far more and faster if they learn how to teach
        themselves. Teach them how to use internet searches effectively
        to find out answers. Ask them the questions that lead you to
        solutions, and encourage them to start doing this themselves.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Share Work from the Start**

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Get parents involved in helping sort all the admin things, get
        children mentoring early on. It is much harder to 'retrofit' to
        a dojo once it has been up and running for a while.

  - **Cater for Beginners**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        It is most unlikely that you want to run an 'elite' dojo that is
        only for the high fliers. You want to have activities such as
        HTML or Scratch where all children can get results right away. I
        prefer the route Scratch first, then HTML, then javascript in
        HTML, then other languages. I've too often seen going straight
        to python in a dojo not working, with the same information
        repeated over and over lecture-style. The beginners class can
        and should have demos of quite challenging projects to inspire
        children to try harder things.

  - **Experiment with the format**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        We've introduced debating on technology topics in the dojo. It
        works very well. We invited a speaker from bitsmith games to
        talk about making games. Some months later a group of children
        had self organised to use the Unity SDK (free download) to learn
        about writing their own games. We tried using Udacity to build
        on python. That didn't work out. We've tried teamwork in fours
        after of a very good session at Bridge21 run by their mentors.
        It didn't work for us in the lecture theater, and we need to
        iterate and adapt or drop that format. We ran robotics, when we
        had a specialist mentor to run it. It's too much, for us, to do
        when he is not here, so we don't.

  - **Be Tolerant**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        You will meet people along the way who have very strong views,
        and where they don't agree with you, they are obviously wrong.
        No? People do CoderDojo because they care. You'll meet lovely
        people, and people who are a bit nutty. Be ready for it.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Have Children Show Their Work**.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Have some children show their work near the end of the dojo.
        Showing the work to other children can help to inspire other
        children with new ideas they would not have thought of.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Network**

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Make contacts with other dojos. Ideally work with other dojos.
