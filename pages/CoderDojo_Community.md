**[Community Calls](Community_Calls.md)**

With our ever growing community of over 500+ dojos in 48 countries we
realised the need to stay connected. We now have regular USA Community
Call, European and Australian/Asian Community Calls to connect
organisers from around the globe to chat about issues that effect their
Dojos. The calls usually alternate between 9pm GMT & EST on Tuesday &
Thursday nights to accommodate most schedules.

## Community Committee

**[CoderDojo Community
Committee](CoderDojo_Community_Committee.md)**

The CoderDojo community committee is a semi structured group of active
CoderDojo community members whose purpose is to guide and advise the
CoderDojo Foundation on certain key decisions. The Committee acts as an
ear on the ground within the community and gives information about the
needs, challenges and operations of the CoderDojo community in certain
regions.

## [Dojo Groups](Dojo_Groups.md)

Lots of Dojos around the world have formed regional groups to focus on
their countries or regional area.

In [Dojo Groups](Dojo_Groups.md) you can see some case studies
of the different regional groups that have formed around the world and
their structures.
