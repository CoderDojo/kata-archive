 Finding mentors 

## Content

### How do I find mentors and volunteers?

  - **Start locally** - Put up notices in places like local business
    centres or community centres to generate local interest and to find
    mentors and get parents who have technical background involved as
    mentors. We encourage getting non technical mentors
  - **Colleges & Universities** - Approach colleges/universities with
    information on how to become a CoderDojo mentor.
  - **Companies** - Reach out to local companies that may have technical
    employees and encourage them to get involved. We have a [Template
    Letter for Acquiring Mentors from Businesses and
    Universities](Template_Letter_for_Acquiring_Mentors_from_Businesses_and_Universities.md)
    available for you to use should you wish.
  - **Twitter** - Set up a Twitter account for your Dojo and start
    reaching out to your local tech community.
  - **Website** - You can set up a website for your Dojo and have an
    expression of interest form on your site.
  - **Linkedin** - Find out how to get linkedin information for mentors
    [here\!](Linkedin.md)
  - **Cloud Mentoring** - If you still cant find any mentors and live in
    a remote location, Check out our Cloud Mentoring section
    [here\!](Cloud_mentoring.md)

Three survey forms we used recently in CoderDojo Ham to get feedback: i)
from parents ii) from the kids iii) from families who dropped out [Find
