## Becoming a Champion

The first step towards setting up a Dojo is to register your interest as
a CoderDojo [Champion](Champion.md)

## Gathering your Team

Once we have found out a little more about you and your proposed Dojo
the next step is for you to find some [Mentors and
Volunteers](Mentors_and_Volunteers.md) to help you organise and
run your Dojo. We recommend gathering a team of interested and dedicated
individuals from the start, it will really have a positive impact on
your Dojo and cut down the workload for everyone involved.

If it is legally required in your area it is important that you and your
mentors are sufficiently **background checked** to ensure your safety
and that of the young people you will be working with.

You can [find out more about background checking
here](Background_Checking.md).

## Find your Venue

The next step then is to find your [Venue](Venue.md).

## Set a Date

Once you have found your [Venue](Venue.md) and gathered a team
of [Mentors and Volunteers](Mentors_and_Volunteers.md) you can
begin to [Plan your Dojo](Plan_your_Dojo.md). You can hold
planning meetings with your team and plan promoting your Dojo and
getting kids to come, getting more mentors involved and what [Learning
Resources](Learning_Resources.md) you wish to use in your Dojo.
We recommend using [Eventbrite](Eventbrite.md) to register and
manage your attendees.

## Zen

Once you have found a [Venue](Venue.md), some [Mentors and
Volunteers](Mentors_and_Volunteers.md) and have settled on a
target date for your Dojo to start the next step is to register on
[Zen](Zen.md), the Dojo listing system, and create a listing for
your Dojo.

Once your listing has been verified you will visable on the [global map
of Dojos](http://zen.coderdojo.com/).
