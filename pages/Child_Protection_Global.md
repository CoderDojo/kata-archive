## Global Background Checking

The CoderDojo Foundation is currently negotiating partnerships that will
enable background checking of volunteers globally to ensure that all
CoderDojos around the world are safe spaces for young people and
volunteers.

**Watch this space for future opportunities.**

In the meantime check out our guide to Safeguarding Children around the
world. Using best practices you can make your Dojo a safe and supportive
place for young people.
