## Summary

 I designed a way of explaining code to the kids by using
English, within normal code syntax. By creating a game using something
they do everyday, like eating cereal. The idea was to get them used to
thinking about gathering all things needed for a project first and to a
little bit of pseudo code, thinking like a coder and finally theyâ€™d be
reminded of it every time they ate cereal. Then as a final excercise,
quickly make the [game in
scratch.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/152243893/) 

## Tips for use

This is a thinking exercise as well as a Scratch challenge to create
block-based code from text-based pseudocode\!
