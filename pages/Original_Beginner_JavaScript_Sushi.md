## Summary

 [Ninjas](Ninjas.md) learn the basics of modifying
HTML documents with JavaScript, triggering actions and using library
code with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). 

## Tips for use

1.   Copy blank.html, example.html, the images folder and the css folder
    from the [source
    files](https://drive.google.com/a/coderdojo.com/file/d/0B3fF-SL4F7i7T2JHN3oyX1diYnM/view?usp=sharing)
    to the learner's machine before using the cards.
2.   You can also copy the worksheet folder. This contains the
    [PDF](PDF.md) format Sushi Cards.
3.   It's a good idea to ensure that file extensions are visible on the
    target computer.
4.   Ensure that the learner's computer has a text editor installed (we
    recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)). Then give the learner Card 1.
5.   Be aware that when a learner is attempting one of the "fun
    exercises" (in a yellow box on some of the cards) they may need help
    in completing it.
