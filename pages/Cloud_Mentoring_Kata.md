## Summary

 Cloud mentoring 

## Content

CoderDojo strives to create a world where every child has the
opportunity to learn code in a safe, social and collaborative
environment.

CoderDojo believes the deployment of their Cloud Mentoring model is
crucial to achieve this goal, since Cloud Mentors can support dojos in
remote areas where technical mentors are scarce. The Cloud Mentoring
platform serves as a space for Champions of dojos in remote locations to
connect with mentors anywhere in the world to mentor ninjas on specific
technologies during their sessions, using a CoderDojo-approved
collaboration tool.

Currently, CoderDojo is piloting this model using IBM Connections, which
has the SmartCloud Meetings application embedded. IBM Connections is a
licensed product, so only Champions and Cloud Mentors with an active
license will be able to join.

IBM has donated a limited number of licenses of these tools for
CoderDojo to distribute among Champions and Cloud Mentors, which limits
the extent to which CoderDojo can expand the Cloud Mentoring model in
its initial phase.

CoderDojo is looking for a permanent solution, independent of licensed
products, but the timeline to deploy such a platform is still to be
finalised.
