## Summary

 A series of challenges from beginner through to advanced
for controlling LEDs with Arduino. 

## Tips for use

Use the "Blink" example program as a starting point.

## Content

Arduino code for the "Blink" program can be found
[here.](https://github.com/CoderDojo-Bray/arduino/tree/master/dojo-sushi/led)
It is just the standard "Blink" example with some comments added.

There is also the “Blinknodelay” program: a variation on the simple
“Blink” program which does the same thing, but in a different way.
