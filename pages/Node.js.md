Node.js is a software platform that is used to build scalable network
(especially server-side) applications. Node.js utilizes JavaScript as
its scripting language, and achieves high throughput via non-blocking
I/O and a single-threaded event loop.

Node.js contains a built-in HTTP server library, making it possible to
run a web server without the use of external software, such as Apache or
Lighttpd, and allowing more control of how the web server works.

The ability to create an entire web application in JavaScript, both
server-side and client-side, is particularly attractive to web
developers.
