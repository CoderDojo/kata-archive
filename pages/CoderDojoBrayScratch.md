## Games and Animations using Scratch from MIT

 This is Scratch sushi from beginner level to something
that takes a bit of effort, suitable from 7 years upwards and for a
six-week program with 2 hours per week.  To mentors: Print
and laminate the cards for the kids to share. They can use the Scratch
offline editor (no wifi/internet needed). Lay the cards out at the front
of the room and ask the kids to come up and grab one. Put the easy ones
on the left and the hard ones on the right so they can progress through
them and move at their own pace. Print fewer handouts than you have kids
- that encourages them to share and to talk to each other. During the
first few weeks, check that they've got the idea.

Inspired by Clyde Hatter's work on HTML sushi and developed by CoderDojo
Bray.
