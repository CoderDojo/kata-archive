### What is a CoderDojo Champion?

A CoderDojo Champion is an individual who volunteers to take charge of
setting up, running and maintaining a Dojo.

Champions do not have to have the ability to computer program, but
should possess the skills required to bring together technical Mentors
and supporters and to arrange a Venue to run the Dojo.

You don't have to know how to code, just have to have passion for the
mission and the drive to make things happen\! Ideal Champions are great
at running events, gathering and organising people with the relevant
skills.
