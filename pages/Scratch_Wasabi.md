## Summary

 Scratch Sushi Cards with visual design. Mix and match
different ingredients to build your own game\! 

## Tips for use

You can download and print cards individually; alternatively, the whole
collection is available as one file created for EU Code Week.

Another set has also been designed specially for making a pack of
individual, one-sided A5 cards. *(Note that we are still working on
these for some of the A4 examples ... updates to follow\!)*

Example Scratch project files for each of the individual items on the
cards are available in the [Scratch on-line
