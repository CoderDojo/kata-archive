### HTML & CSS for Complete Beginners

Here are the zip files we downloaded during the first 5 days in Dublin
15 ITB. It assumes no prior knowledge of HTML or CSS, hence the gentle
language used particularly in the first two tutorials.

Feel free to use or alter these in any other CojoDojos as you wish.

For all editing of HTML, we used Notepad++ on Windows and TextWrangler
for the
Mac.
