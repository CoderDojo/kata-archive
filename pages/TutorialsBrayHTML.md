Bray HTML/CSS tutorials are a rapid 5-week block, assuming no prior
knowledge.

They show how to use simple HTML tags, use CSS to style a
professional-looking drop-down menu, layout a page using CSS into
header, menubar and columns, and also give a very brief introduction to
Javascript for simple colour animation.

Each session is broken down into several sections, each improving on the
previous section.

The tutorials are hosted on GitHub
