## Summary

 [Ninjas](Ninjas.md) learn to build their first web
pages, including headings, links, images, tables and formatting.


## Tips for use

1.  The zip file doesn't include the XAMPP installer. You will need to
    download it beforehand. You can download the latest version
    [HERE](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
2.  You can also copy the worksheets folder. This contains the
    [PDF](PDF.md) format Sushi Cards,
    so as they can have them for use after the [Dojo](Dojo.md).
3.  Be aware when a learner is doing a card with fun exercise as they
    might need help in completing it.
4.  A text file with the SQL statements for each step is included in the
    zip file for ninja's who are having a hard time typing.
5.  It's a good idea to ensure that file extensions are visible on the
    target computer.
