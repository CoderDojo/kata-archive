## Problem

Kids are all at different ages, levels of experience and not only that
some will have missed lessons we may be trying to build on.

## Possible Solutions

  - Use different rooms for different activities, that also are at
    different levels.
  - Don't try to have a linear progression from one lesson to the next.
  - Do creative activities, where the kids choose what html-adventure or
    what Scratch animation they will do, and mentors go round helping
    whatever level they are at.
  - **Pair programming\!**
      - Example: Pair kids into novice/veteran duos with the veteran at
        the computer.
          - Instruct the novices to watch the veteran and look for
            syntax errors, typos, etc. It's also helpful for shy kids if
            you have an icebreaker introduction for partners.
          - Instruct veterans to explain their code to the novice,
            answering any questions they have.
          - After the first 30-60 min, switch places with the novice
            typing and veteran watching.
          - For more interaction, cycle novices around the room (or
            among veterans working with language *XYZ* )

## Actual Experience

At Science Gallery CoderDojo we have a room for starting HTML, a room
for intermediate HTML/css/Javascript and a lecture hall for pythonistas.

In UCD CoderDojo we have about 8 tables and the tables are very roughly
sorted by age. There are more accompanying parents at the very youngest
tables, and that helps a lot.

At Iowa City, we have used pair programming effectively with our
HTML/css class. Our computer lab has large aisles, so two chairs at a
computer easily fit. In addition, all our kids are \~the same age. It
has been very effective in helping the girls in the class to feel more
comfortable (they are a bit outnumbered by the boys).
