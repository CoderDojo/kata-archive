### \#PowerfulPlay Campaign

CoderDojo Foundation is working in conjunction with Liberty Global on a
communications campaign to raise awareness about Mentor shortage for
Dojos in the aim to source new Mentors, to volunteer at their local
Dojo, and new CoderDojo Champions, to start Dojos in their regions.

This campaign is aimed to target general public, parents and adults, the
aim is to get more people to become a Coderdojo Champion and start their
own CoderDojo coding club to inspire the next generation for young
coders and digital creators\! We plan to get as many people as we can to
help us spread the word by sharing the four digital posters (attached
below) via their social networks and within their organisations.
