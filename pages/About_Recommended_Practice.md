### CoderDojo Tao (Recommended Practice)

**CoderDojo Tao** (Recommended Practice/RP) is a set of best practice
principles for the global CoderDojo community. It was piloted in
Summer/Autumn 2014 and will be launched to all Dojos globally through
the CoderDojo Community Platform in Summer 2015.

**You can see Recommended Practice Handbook below\!**

With the development of the CoderDojo Community Platform we are going to
be implementing CoderDojo Tao into the on boarding process for Dojos so
that is in seamless for Dojos to align. If you are interested in
aligning with RP before the launch of the [CoderDojo Community
Platform](https://coderdojo.com/news/2015/03/19/announcing-the-new-coderdojo-community-platform/)
or if you have any questions please contact info\[at\]coderdojo.com for
more information.

  - Note: After a vote of all pilot participants for CoderDojo
    Recommended Practice the decision was made to rename Recommended
    Practice (RP) to CoderDojo Tao, *The CoderDojo Path*.

Along with the code of Recommended Practice, there are a few other
documents we would love you to read\! Please find the supporting Tao
documents in this section too\!
