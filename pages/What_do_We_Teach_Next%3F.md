## Problem

We've shown simple animations. What do we teach next?

## Possible Solutions

  - In the very first lesson, find out what the kids want. Pick
    something from that list.
  - Ask the kids.
  - Find a mentor who has a deep interest in a topic, and start a table
    with that topic. If it goes well, it will spread to other tables.

## Actual Experience

Science Gallery CoderDojo went too fast into animation in Javascript,
and introduced too much 'technology'. We're now going back over some of
the component elements, like event handling, but still using animation
examples. We've also branched out and have some of the kids learning to
use an image editor (GIMP) to make images, especially the transparency,
for use in a computer game. We have a list of things the kids want to
explore, and music is one we have not gone to yet. The plan is to start
that at one table, using Audacity to teach about how sound is
represented in a computer, and how to make sound effects for a game.

UCD CoderDojo is still exploring Scratch and hasn't yet hit this
problem. Breaking for the summer may have helped here\!
