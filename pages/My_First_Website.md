## Summary

 The original Sushi Cards\! Suitable for offline coding.
[Ninjas](Ninjas.md) learn to build their first web pages,
including headings, links, images, tables and formatting. 

## Tips for use

1.  Copy the about-me.html file and the images and css folders from the
    [source
    files](https://drive.google.com/a/coderdojo.com/file/d/0B3fF-SL4F7i7NFF3RThaRFQ1X0k/view?usp=sharing)
    to the Ninja's machine before using the cards.
2.  You can also copy the worksheets folder. This contains the
    [PDF](PDF.md) format Sushi Cards,
    so as they can have them for use after the [Dojo](Dojo.md).
3.  It's a good idea to ensure that file extensions are visible on the
    target computer.
4.  Get the learner started by opening about-me.html in a browser and
    also in Notepad (or [text editor](Text_Editors.md) of your
    choice - we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)) and then arranging
    them side-by-side. Then give the learner Card 1.
