## Approved editors

When you sign up for Kata you do not automatically have the right to
edit content. This is because we receive a *very* large volume of spam
account sign-ups. Approved editors are those who have been granted
permission to edit Kata.

## Becoming an approved editor

Becoming an approved Kata editor is a very straightforward process. Just
mail info@coderdojo.org with the subject line "Activate Kata editing"
and the following information:

  - Your name
  - Your Dojo
  - Your role at the Dojo
  - Your Kata username
