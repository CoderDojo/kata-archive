What is a library? In programming, a library is a collection of
precompiled routines that a program can use. The routines, sometimes
called modules, are stored in object format. Libraries are particularly
useful for storing frequently used routines because you do not need to
explicitly link them to every program that uses
them.

        Massively multiplayer online role-playing games: are online
        role-playing video games in which a very large number of people
        participate simultaneously. They blend the genres of
        role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games,
        potentially in the form of web browser-based games, in which a
        very large number of players interact with one another within a
        world.
