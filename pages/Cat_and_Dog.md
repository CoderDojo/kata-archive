Created by Pam O'Brien

The purpose of this project is to show how you can have 2 characters or
sprites each doing different things. I chose a cat and a dog but you can
choose any characters you like or even draw your own.

The cat moves based on the arrow keys (up, down, left and right) and the
dog constantly moves over and back across the screen. The dog switches
between costumes to make it look like he is actually walking. When using
next costume make sure to have more than 1 costume for the sprite. To
get more than one costume you can click on the Costumes tab for the
sprite and then import another costume.

'''To create a background '''

This project also has a background. Click on Stage and then click on the
Background tab. From here you can either import a backfround form what
is available or again you can edit the current plain background and
create your own.

'''Script for Dog '''

The 'if on edge bounce' is used to get the dog to turn when he gets to
the end of the screen.
