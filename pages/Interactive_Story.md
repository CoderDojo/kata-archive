## Summary

 Create interactive fiction using the Twine platform.


## Tips for use

Below are two versions of the same activity: the original workshop for
the older Twine 1.4 (desktop installation) and an updated version for
Twine 2 (web based).

Additional files required, <b>LibraryAdventure.tws</b> for Twine 1.4 and
<b>LibraryAdventure.html</b> for Twine2, can be downloaded from the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/CoderDojoScotland/BookDojo)

Keep in mind that as with any creative tool, whether it's text-, video-,
or photo-based, not all the Twine stories on the web will be suitable
for younger readers.

1.  Download the Twine application (for Windows or Mac depending on your
    computer) from \[twinery.org twinery.org\]

    finished installing.
3.  Go to the file menu and open the file LibraryAdventure.tws that you
    downloaded

5.  You can write down your own choice of story elements on a print out
    of TwineHandoutSheet.pdf if you like.
