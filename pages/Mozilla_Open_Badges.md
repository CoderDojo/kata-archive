### Mozilla Open Badges:

Learning today happens everywhere, not just in the classroom. But it's
often difficult to get recognition for skills and achievements that
happen outside of school. [Mozilla's Open
Badges](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges) project is working to solve
that problem, making it easy for anyone to issue, earn and display
badges across the web. The result: helping people of all ages gain and
display 21st century skills and unlock new career and educational
opportunities.

This July, CoderDojo Scotland joined other companies such as NASA and
Disney-Pixar by becoming an [Mozilla Open Badge
issuer](http://coderdojoscotland.com/blog/203/open-badges-at-coderdojo-scotland).
