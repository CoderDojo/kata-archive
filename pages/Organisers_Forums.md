One of our most active support forums is the Forums on Zen. Here
CoderDojo Champions and Mentors from all over the world share their
experiences, post their questions and engage in discussion in relation
to all things CoderDojo. We would encourage all community members to
join these private forums to discuss all things CoderDojo with other
organisers and mentors from around the world.

Topics can include; mentor acquisition and retention, CoderDojo Girls,
Dojo funding and cool tools and learning resources.

You can apply to join the Forums [here.](https://forums.coderdojo.com/)

**Please Note: You will have to register and create an account on zen to
post in the forums.** You can register on Zen

All posts in the forums should be related to CoderDojo.

This group is for mentors and Champions in the CoderDojo Community.
