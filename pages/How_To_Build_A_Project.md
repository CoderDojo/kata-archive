## Summary

 A set of worksheets to guide Ninjas through the process of
designing a project to showcase at the Coolest Projects event. They
contain prompts and questions with the aim of providing not only
inspiration and guidance but also to provoke thought on the intended
goals of the project and the needs users. 

## Tips for use

The worksheets are designed to be printed out and given to Ninjas to
fill in using pens, pencils, crayons or markers.

Depending on the type of project being designed, e.g. Scratch, mobile
app, website, etc, it may be useful to print out some device-specific
templates for the "Design and build" phase (Step 4). Blank templates for
various devices can be found
[here](Screen_Design_Templates.md).

Additional blank testing sheets are also available
[here](Project_Testing_Sheets.md) for
further iterations of the "Test and tweak" phase (Step 5).

## Content

The worksheets are inspired by the [Stanford
d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu/) ‘Design Thinking’ process and
the [Design Club](http://www.designclub.org.uk/) workshops along with
feedback from those involved in Dojos.
