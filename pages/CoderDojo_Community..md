\--Community Calls--

With our ever growing community of over 250 dojos in 31 countries we
realized the need to stay connected. With this weâ€™d like to announce
[CoderDojo community
Calls](http://coderdojo.com/resources/community-calls)\! We welcome you
to join us for monthly calls to discuss starting, running and growing
your dojo.
