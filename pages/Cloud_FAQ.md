• **Is the Cloud Mentoring model the right model for my dojo?**

  - 
    
      -   
        If you are the champion of a registered dojo and are having
        trouble finding local mentors to either start your dojo or grow
        it beyond basic programming tools, this may be the right model
        for you.
        The only other critical aspect to ensure the success of this
        model is whether you have an internet connection stable enough
        to run a SmartCloud Meeting for the length of your dojo event

• **I am a champion and I want to find Cloud Mentors to help me run my
dojo, what should I do?**

  - 
    
      -   
        The first step is to record your interest in the Cloud Mentoring
        model using this form \[link to form\]. Currently, CoderDojo is
        using IBM Communities and SmartCloud Meetings to support this
        model, and access to licenses is limited. If a license is
        available, a member of the CoderDojo Foundation will reach back
        to you with next steps

• **Will the same Cloud Mentor be working with me and my dojo for a
series of sessions? Or do I need to identify different Cloud Mentors for
each session?**

  - 
    
      -   
        This will depend on the Cloud Mentors’ availability and how
        restrictive you want to be when partnering with them. Ideally,
        you will be able to partner with at least one mentor for the
        first 2-3 months, to give some consistency to the ninjas’
        experience while they get used to the remote mentoring model,
        but this is something you have to discuss with individual Cloud
        Mentors signing up to support your dojo

• **Should I sign up to be a cloud mentor?**

  - 
    
      -   
        Whether you are a pro at Python, can write HTML blindfolded or
        love tinkering with hardware like Raspberry Pis and robotics
        your knowledge and experience would be welcome at any Dojo,
        either local or remote\!
        If you are having a hard time finding a local dojo that fits
        your schedule, or simply want to support a dojo in a remote
        location that most likely won’t be able to run without your
        help, you are a perfect candidate to volunteer as a Cloud Mentor

• **I just signed up to be a Cloud Mentor, what should I expect of my
first dojo session?**

  - 
    
      -   
        The experience will be similar to that one of an in person
        session, except that you will be chatting through an online
        meetings tool with students instead of answering their questions
        in person. To learn more about what to expect of the CoderDojo
        mentor experience, click here \[link to kata, article below\].

• **When will this model be open to all?**

  - 
    
      -   
        Currently, CoderDojo is using IBM Communities and Meetings to
        support this model. IBM has donated a limited number of licenses
        to CoderDojo, which will allow to expand this initiative to some
        scale, but CoderDojo is looking for a permanent solution based
        on open source tools so there is no limit to the number of dojos
        supported by Cloud Mentors. However the timeline for such
        expansion is still being finalised. For now, if you are
        interested in becoming a Cloud Mentor fill in this form \[link
        to form\] and if you are the champion of a dojo looking for
        Cloud Mentors fill in the form below. A member of the CoderDojo
        Foundation will reach out to you with next steps whenever a
        license becomes available.
