Processing.js is a JavaScript port of Processing, a programming language
designed to write visualizations, images, and interactive content. It
allows web browsers to display animations, visual applications, games
and other graphical rich content without the need for a Java applet or
Flash plugin.

Processing.js uses JavaScript to render 2D and 3D content on the HTML
canvas element, and is supported by browsers that have implemented this
element (the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet
Explorer 9, Safari and Google Chrome).

The development of Processing.js was begun by John Resig and then
picked-up by students at Seneca College after its initial release in
2008. A team of students finished the port of Processing.js, fixing more
than 900 bugs, shipping 12 releases, and creating a vibrant community in
the process. The project was done through a partnership between the
Mozilla Foundation and Seneca College, led by David Humphrey, Al
MacDonald, and Corban Brook. The students continue to maintain the
project Processing.js

<https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/> Great Online teaching resource uses
processing.js

<http://sketchpad.cc/> - Allows for online collaborative programming of
Processing sketches. Has several great features for dojo - ability to
track code revisions over time (see progressive elaboration at work),
set up a "studio" area for a particular dojo or class, and tons of
shared programs available for study.
