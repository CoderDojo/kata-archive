\_\_NOTOC\_\_

A selection of documents, videos, elearning materials etc. are curated
and available here for you to use at your Dojo. We have organised them
into [Paths](Path.md) that allow your Dojo to follow a course
through a particular topic moving from beginner to advanced levels, with
supplementary resources and suggested projects, as well as the
[badges](badge.md) that can likely be awarded to
[Ninjas](Ninja.md) that progress through the path.
