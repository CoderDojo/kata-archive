## Summary

 A blocks-based programming tool that allows everyone, even
novices, to start programming and build fully functional apps for
Android devices. Newcomers to App Inventor can have their first app up
and running in an hour or less, and can program more complex apps in
significantly less time than with more traditional, text-based
languages. Find tutorials
