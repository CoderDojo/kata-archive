### Wants

  - **Contest(s)** Not to a time such as 6 hours, more like project
    work. Not one grand prize, but a number of smaller ones.
  - **(more) Activity Cards** To include loops, arrays, random numbers,
    and using GIMP to make in-game graphics.
  - **4 x USB Keys**, pre-loaded with wifi content, in case wifi is
    down.
  - **Old Hardware**, e.g. inside a disk drive, what does a memory card
    look like, why do computers have fans?. This was a good mid-activity
    break at the UCD CoderDojo, i.e. something not glued to the screen.

### Suggestions

  - **Ninja Editor Badge** To get kids using the editors fluently - many
    are still typing much more than they need to.

### Offers

  - **Activity Cards**
