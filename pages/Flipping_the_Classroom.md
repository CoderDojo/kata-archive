Kids at Dojos should not be forced into standardised courses where
everyone has to conform to the same standards at the same point in time.
We can instead produce online content which can be accessed and
assimilated by children at home which gives them an increase in their
knowledge which they can then bring to the group and interact in a
spontaneous manner except this time with a lot more knowledge already
under their belt.

It would great to create an opensource and dynamic map of learning
progression where kids can track their learning with a basic
understanding of dependency (e.g. if you want to do relational database
programming with sql you need to have an understanding of html, php, sql
queries, phpmyadmin? and relational databases). You can see how khan
academy has already created a map such as this for the subject of
mathematics

the most important thing is that kids teach kids much more effectively
than a single mentor could ever impart knowledge. This is slightly
terrifying for those trained in standard pedagogical methods. Instead we
need to utilise the grandma method of open encouragement with only
limited structured lecture, this video is really great.
