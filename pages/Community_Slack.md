We have created a slack channel for the CoderDojo community. Slack is an
instant messaging tool that a lot of organisations use on a daily basis
to communicate with each other directly. Here CoderDojo Champions and
Mentors from all over the world share their experiences, post their
questions and engage in discussion in relation to all things CoderDojo.
We would encourage all community members to join these private forums to
discuss all things CoderDojo with other organisers and mentors from
around the world.

Topics can include; mentor acquisition and retention, CoderDojo Girls,
Dojo funding and cool tools and learning resources.

You can join this community by entering your email here:
<https://coderdojo.com/coderdojo-global-slack/>

**Please Note: You will have to register and create an account on Slack
to join in the conversation.** You can register on Slack
[here.](https://coderdojoglobal.slack.com/)

All posts in the forums should be related to CoderDojo.

This group is for mentors and Champions in the CoderDojo Community.
