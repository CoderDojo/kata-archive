From post to Coderdojo.org e-mail list, 16th Feb 2014:

Some things that I can say definititvely after nearly three years;

  - Get kids (particularly girls) mentoring the newbies in each session
    and ask them to all start with html, css and javascript.

<!-- end list -->

  - Age is irrelevant its capability and interest that count. Some 6
    year olds work as effectively as some 16 year olds.

<!-- end list -->

  - Keep instruction to a minimum no more than 15 minutes out of an hour
    and nit at the very start of the session.

<!-- end list -->

  - Repeat the same instruction over different session.

<!-- end list -->

  - Make sure there is tons of free time in any dojo session.

<!-- end list -->

  - Publicly praise and celebrate the great things you spot kids doing
    so other kids come and look.

<!-- end list -->

  - Ask kids to come up with projects that they want to work on in
    teams.

<!-- end list -->

  - Belts work.
