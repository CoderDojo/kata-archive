## \#PowerfulPlay

CoderDojo Foundation is working in conjunction with Liberty Global on a
communications campaign to raise awareness about Mentor shortage for
Dojos in the aim to source new Mentors, to volunteer at their local
Dojo, and new CoderDojo Champions, to start Dojos in their regions.

This campaign is aimed to target general public, parents and adults, the
aim is to get more people to become a Coderdojo Champion and start their
own CoderDojo coding club to inspire the next generation for young
coders and digital creators\!

We plan to get as many people as we can to help us spread the word by
sharing the four digital posters (attached below) via their social
networks and within their organisations.

CoderDojo reach new audiences\! there is a campaign deck to fill you in
