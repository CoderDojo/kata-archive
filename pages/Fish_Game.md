This project is a game with 2 characters, a shark and a fish. The aim of
the game is to move the shark so that he can eat the fish. When the
shark is touching the fish, the fish disappears and the score goes up by
1. We use hide to get the fish to disappear. The fish will reappear at a
different part of the screen.

**Variables**

A new feature in this project is the score variable. This variable is
created in the variables block. Once the variable is created you can set
the value, change the value etc. Click on make a variable and then put
score in the variable name.

'''Fish '''

The fish has 2 costumes to make it look like he is opening and closing
his mouth. He moves randomly which is achieved by the 'turn pick random
... degrees'. the 'go to x pick random ... y pick random ...' makes him
reappear in a different part of the screen.
