For getting background checked in the UK individuals must go through the
Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).

For more information on this please see the GOV.UK website
[here\>\>\>.](https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview)

We recommend that before volunteering as a CoderDojo mentor that
individuals sign up as a StemNet ambassador (which they can do
[here](http://www.stemnet.org.uk/ambassadors/) ) and Stemnet will
provide extra information and free DBS checking in return for mentors
volunteering at least one Stem event per year, which includes a
CoderDojo session\!

  - Note: The CoderDojo Foundation are currently working on a wider
    official partnership with StemNet so watch this space\!
