## Summary

 [Ninjas](Ninjas.md) will learn the basic skills
needed to create your own game, including sprite movement and collision
detection\! By the end you will have a cat who meows when she catches
her mouse. This will probably take less than half-an-hour to complete.


## Tips for use

You will need to either install Scratch on the
[Ninja](Ninja.md)'s machine or use the [web-based
editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/) in advance of using these cards.
