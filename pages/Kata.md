Kata is the CoderDojo community resource sharing platform. It is a tool
for members of the CoderDojo Community to discover and share resources
that they have found valuable in running their Dojos.

## Resource types

These resources might be [educational](Paths.md), to provide
material for a Dojo to work on, or focused on helping Dojo
[Champions](Champion.md) setup
and run their Dojo.

## Contributing to Kata

### Filling in the blanks

There are a number of articles and categories throughout Kata that may
be referenced but still lacking descriptions. They have red link text.
Just click on one where you know the term and fill in the details\!

the community\!) you can add it by following the instructions
