## Summary

 The original series\! Suitable for offline coding. Improve
your exisiting web pages by making them responsive using
[CSS](CSS.md). 

## Tips for use

1.  Copy the zipped [source
    file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3fF-SL4F7i7SmtJekhVY2VvYmM)
    to the Ninja's machine before using the cards.
2.  The zip file contains the worksheet folder. This contains the
    [PDF](PDF.md) format Sushi Cards,
    so as they can have them for use after the [Dojo](Dojo.md).
3.  It's a good idea to ensure that file extensions are visible on the
    target computer.
4.  Get the learner started by opening about-me.html in a browser and
    also in Notepad (or [text editor](Text_Editors.md) of your
    choice - we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)) and then arranging
    them side-by-side. Then give the learner Card 1.
