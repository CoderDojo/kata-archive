## Processing.js

Processing.js is the sister project of the popular Processing visual
programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your
data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational
graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any
plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in
your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but
almost.
