So lets do it\! Its a pretty straight forward process. \_\_TOC\_\_

  - Firstly you should to set up an email specific to your Dojo (eg
    "coderDojoWales@gmail.com") and a Twitter account (eg
    "@CoderDojoWales". Then you can get the message out and get people
    interested to follow the twitter account for updates. Follow
    @coderdojo and we'll help spread the word about your new Dojo.

<!-- end list -->

  - Next you need to find a few more **volunteers**, Ideally if you
    could have at least 3 Mentors with coding skills and you can
    encourage parents to stay during sessions and help with the
    operation of your Dojo.

<!-- end list -->

  - Then you need a **space**, local tech business, incubators,
    schools/colleges are great. Then you hold a small get together of
    people interested in helping out, here a Q\&A would be done and a
    more info would be given on CoderDojo.

<!-- end list -->

  - Next we **pick a date** and push it, ideally the date would be set 3
    - 5 weeks from announcement depending on the amount of young people
    already interested.

<!-- end list -->

  - We recommend if you can that you visit a local Dojo that is in
    operation, however the CoderDojo community has a large online
    presence so if you cannot physically visit a Dojo you can find
    videos and Dojo activity information from Dojos all around the world
    through a Google search.

# Start a Dojo

Setting up a CoderDojo is an exciting and straight forward process.
We’ve broken up this article into 3 parts.

  - A Dojo’s requirements
  - How to get these and the start up process
  - Advice and Tips

For the entire Dojo process, we can support you and give advice, just
email: startup@coderdojo.com.

We can’t stress enough, just like software, just ship the first version
of your CoderDojo. By just getting out there and doing it, you can
evaluate resources, interest, time commitment and so on afterwards.

## A Dojo’s requirements

  - CoderDojos should be **free of charge** and no money should change
    hands and this has been worked out in nearly all cases. For anything
    your CoderDojo needs don’t be shy go out and ask your local
    community and it’s leaders in business and government. CoderDojos
    are a no brainer when it comes to getting support from nearly any
    high tech business.
  - **Space with Internet** - We suggest a local office building that
    has a big empty space, such as a cafeteria, that is not normally
    used on a weekend. (heat, light and lots of power sockets also help
    a lot)
  - Rhythm – CoderDojo’s work well on being **open on a regular basis**,
    many Dojos run every Saturday, but this can vary based on the
    resources you have at hand.
  - **Volunteers and Mentors** – you need people who will come help out,
    teach the sessions, help tidy up and get the space ready.
  - A **Champion/Co-ordinator** – You need someone who will just show up
    week in week out to make sure that your Dojo can be relied upon to
    be there and be a point of contact for that Dojo\!
  - A **Listing on Zen** – Just add your Dojo to Zen, the network of
    Dojos and people involved.

Above All: **Be Cool** – CoderDojo has just one rule and “Above All: Be
Cool” that is it. Bullying, lying, wasting peoples time and so on, is
uncool. Just stick by the one rule and put an emphasis on it and these
problems just don’t show up. And that's pretty much it\! Now on to how
to get these\!

## The start up process

  - Go create a **listing on Zen** (http://zen.coderdojo.com), the
    network behind CoderDojo. You can create a listing here for your
    Dojo and maintain it. You can also see any nearby Dojos and get in
    touch. (Note your Dojo will not appear in main listing until
    verified, we only a hourly to daily basis check the pending Dojos,
    if you’re not verified after a day, contact us\!). Lindsay has made
    a video explaining the process here
    (http://screencast.com/t/h5heB2nhNc)
  - If possible go **check out a nearby Dojo** and see how it runs.
    Email other Dojos and ask questions about what it's like running in
    your locale if there are preexisting Dojos near you.
  - Firstly you need to set up a **google discussion group**
    (http://groups.google.com/) (eg “CoderDojo Wales”) and a twitter
    account (eg “@CoderDojoWales”). Interested people can easily find
    you, get in contact and keep in the loop this way. Have the
    CoderDojo logo as the profile picture, make sure you do have some
    text on it to illustrate your location (eg have the word “Wales” or
    “SF” on it like here) and be sure to follow @CoderDojo . Go back
    and update the Zen listing with this info.
  - Next you need to find a few **volunteers**, Ideally if you could
    have at least 3 people with coding skills. 8 is normally a great
    number.
  - Push message out, send out your Dojo listing on Zen and get people
    interested to follow the **twitter account for updates** and join
    the discussion group. Normally if you are or get a tech person
    involved, they’ll have a few friends they can rope in to help
    mentor.
  - Then you need a **space**, local tech business, incubators,
    schools/colleges are great. The space you ideally want would be
    relatively open plan, where you can drag and move around tables and
    chairs to keep a good, informal environment, **staying away from the
    very linear classroom like layout**.
  - **Hold a small get together** of people interested in helping out,
    here a Q\&A would be done and a more info would be given on
    CoderDojo.
  - Next **pick a date and push it**, ideally the date would be set 3 –
    5 weeks from announcement depending on the amount of young people
    already interested.
  - Try to **contact a fellow volunteer** from a nearby Dojo and get
    someone out there to help with the first session. Remember, for this
    entire process, we can hold your hand, just email us:
    startup@coderdojo.com and a volunteer will help you out.

After your first session, sit down with the mentors and volunteers,
discuss how it went, time commitment, space and so on and evaluate.

Well done. You did it\! You are Awesome

## Advice and Tips

  - **Join other Dojos discussion groups and come visit other Dojos
    prior**, to get a feeling for the running of them\! You can get more
    information about other Dojos here. If you can’t make it out, we can
    set up Skype for you to see.
  - **Encourage all the parents or guardians to stick around**, ideally
    any person 12 or younger would have someone responsible there for
    them. This stops it being used a child minding service and
    parents/guardians are really useful to have on hand\!
  - **Make sure that everyone knows to help each other** and if needed
    share their laptop – Learning how to collaborate to figure stuff out
    is an essential. If one person gets something before another, get
    them to show the other person how they did it. Welcome new people.
    Get one of the more experience people to bring them through the
    basics of HTML or whatever language they’re experienced in\!
  - **Don’t stress** – Some young people will come back and some won’t.
    Some will drop in occasionally and some will complain. Don’t worry
    its not for everyone just do the best you can and stay cool.
  - Use **free online tools** to help -Get them to check out Codecademy,
    SitePoint, Google Uni, Mozilla Dev, Opera Dev or w3schools.com (be
    carefully about w3schools though, see w3fools.com)

When faced with a question you cannot answer its often best to simply
**recommend google.com** as its good to get young people and old to
think about how to figure it out for themselves.

  - **Encourage collaboration** – Often the best way to really learn
    something is to teach it and the more social interaction the better
    so encourage everyone to learn together and when you see someone
    doing something really **cool get them to show it** to everyone.
  - Inspire creativity – **Ask for suggestions of projects and challenge
    from everywhere**. Local school needs a web page? Local charity need
    an app? Who better to deliver a project than a local CoderDojo
  - **Hack CoderDojo** – CoderDojo is open source so take what works and
    feel free to mash it up and make it work in new ways for different
    stuff. Do something cool? Tell us\!
  - For booking systems, we recommend **Eventbrite**, a list of reasons
    for this can be found here:
    <http://kata.coderdojo.com/index.php?title=Booking>

Go out, kick ass and make a difference to the lives of some young
people.
