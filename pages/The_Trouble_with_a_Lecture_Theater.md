## Problem

A lecture theater discourages the 1:1 teaching that normally happens in
a CoderDojo classroom as mentors go around the room helping out.

## Possible Solutions

  - Ask that alternate rows are left empty so that mentors can move
    around amongst the kids learning.
  - Ask people to sit at the row ends rather than in the middle of the
    rows.
  - Get some tables on the stage area so that at least some of the kids
    get 1:1 mentoring.

## Actual Experience

At Science Gallery CoderDojo, even with asking, people tend to sit where
they will. Unlike at LIT, the stage area is not really large enough to
accommodate tables.
