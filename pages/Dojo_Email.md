**Issuing Guidelines:**

If requested during the Dojo verification stage, a Dojo can be set up
with a coderdojo.com email address.

Email address will be issued using the following format
<Dojo Name>.<country tld>@coderdojo.com US Dojos will get
<Dojo Name>.\<2 Letter State ID\>.<Country TLD>@coderdojo.com If someone
starts to help nationally or Internationally they will be allowed an
email address using the following format
<First Name>.<Last Name>@coderdojo.com

For Dojo's that have requested separate address for things like
Registration's we suggest using
<Dojo Name>+Registration.<country tld>@coderdojo.com and set up a filter
in their account to label the incoming email accordingly.

County codes to be used:
