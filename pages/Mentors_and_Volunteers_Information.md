### What is the difference between a mentor and volunteer?

Please note an updated version will be uploaded soon. You can find a
promo video aimed at encouraging mentors to get involved with local
Dojos below\!

A **mentor** is a technically skilled individual who guides Dojo
attendees and facilitates their learning and project work during the
sessions. Mentors usually have a preferred area and expertise within
which they like to work (eg. HTML, Python etc.) and this can influence
the topics covered in the Dojo.

A **volunteer** is an individual who helps with administration and
related services. Parents of regular attendees and non technical
individuals who want to help out often work in Dojos. It is also not
uncommon for volunteers to learn the basics of Scratch and be able to
work with beginners as a mentor.
