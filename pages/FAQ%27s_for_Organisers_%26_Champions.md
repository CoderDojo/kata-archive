## The Questions

  

**What do I need to do to set up a dojo?**

  -   
    See [Organising a Dojo](Organising_a_Dojo.md).

**Where do you find your volunteers? What level of IT skills would they
need?**

  -   
    We find a good mix of programmers from the industry alongside
    interested parents and community volunteers with a healthy dose of
    students to liven things up works well. As long as people are
    enthusiastic about helping kids to develop their coding skills it
    doesn't really matter what their technical ability is.

**Is there a teaching pack?**

  -   
    Every dojo is different both in style and in what is taught in the
    dojo. Look here on this kata wiki for resources for mentoring that
    have been shared.

**How do I get a background check set up for my mentors? Insurance for
the dojo? What about child protection awareness training? Written codes
of conduct?**

  -   
    Garda Vetting (in Ireland), Insurance, child protection awareness
    training and safe systems for working with children all take some
    work to set up. It is something the whole organising group needs to
    pay attention to, and it is important to involve parent volunteers
    in this otherwise the technical mentors end up doing everything, and
    being overloaded, or things that should be done don't get done. Many
    dojos have been through the steps already and are keen to help new
    dojos that are starting out. There is an e-mail google group for
    open and general discussions about child protection systems and
    youth work in coderdojo. Ask about it at <info@coderdojo.com> if you
    want more information.
