## Important Notice

We’ve moved our educational content to our [new projects
site](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo). It has more
projects in over 12 languages, filters that make finding projects much
easier, a modern interactive design and it’s actively being improved\!

Find out more about why we’re moving our educational resources
[here](https://coderdojo.com/2018/09/07/launching-our-new-projects-site/).

## Kata

Welcome to Kata, the CoderDojo community resource sharing platform\! We
provide a selection of resources that you can use in running or setting
up your Dojo.

## Kata in other languages

## Learning resources

A selection of documents, videos, elearning materials etc. are curated
and available here for you to use at your Dojo. We have organised them
into [Paths](Path.md) that allow your Dojo to follow a course
through a particular topic moving from beginner to advanced levels, with
supplementary resources and suggested projects, as well as the
[badges](badge.md) that can likely be awarded to
[Ninjas](Ninja.md) that progress through the path.

## Organiser resources

These resources are designed to help you understand what is involved in
setting up and running a CoderDojo.
