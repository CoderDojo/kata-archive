## Experience

At Science Gallery we had a group of seven very enthusiastic children
who made mods to Minecraft Java code, starting with tutorials on
youTube. They helped each other with tasks like installing Eclipse and
decompiling the Java.

The program was WAY bigger than anything they had looked at before, so a
lot of it was about learning to find their way around. "Where is the
constant that controls the size of a TNT explosion?". They got as far as
new crafting recipes and duplicating and very slight change of an entity
- a new kind of cow in Minecraft. They wanted to go much further, but
did not have the maths skills they would have needed, and that was too
high a cliff to climb at that time.

## ScriptCraft

The Scriptcraft javascript control of Minecraft is a more inclusive way
of using minecraft for coding.
