Badges are awarded by a Dojo Champion, or by the CoderDojo Foundation,
to [Ninjas](Ninja.md) and
[Champions](Champion.md). They appear on their
[Zen](Zen.md) profile pages and serve as a visible record of
their achievements in learning skills, contributing to their Dojo and to
the CoderDojo community as a whole.
