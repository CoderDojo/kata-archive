A good venue is vitally important for running a successful Dojo,
**Dojo's cannot be hosted in private residences.**

We recommend looking into local community spaces such as
schools,libraries, community centres, youth centres, colleges and
universities etc. as spaces for hosting your Dojo.

You can also consider approaching businesses, hackspaces, tech hubs and
conference centres in your local area.

We recommend that the young people attending bring their own laptops so
the venue should have, at least, plug sockets for laptops, internet
access and tables and chairs for the attendees.
