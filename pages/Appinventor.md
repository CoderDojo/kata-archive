**[About App
Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/about-us.html)**

MIT App Inventor is a blocks-based programming tool that allows
everyone, even novices, to start programming and build fully functional
apps for Android devices. Newcomers to App Inventor can have their first
app up and running in an hour or less, and can program more complex apps
in significantly less time than with more traditional, text-based
languages.

App Inventor is a cloud-based tool, which means that you can build apps
right in your web browser. **[The App
Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started.html.html)**
website offers all of the support that you'll need as you learn how to
build your own apps. The App Inventor software, or "service" is at
**[(App Inventor)](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)**. You can get there
by clicking the orange "Create" button from any page on this website.
