An open source movement such as CoderDojo has a classical long tail
distribution curve, with a few key kids giving a lot and many giving a
little (same with the mentors). This necessarily means there are large
group sizes and a high turnover rate. It is therefore impossible to
standardise the achievement of programming competence. Instead, content
can be developed and circulated between dojos, allowing individual
mentors to decide whether to operate completely open computer clubs or
more focused courseware arrangements.

The intent of CoderDojo is to remain non-commercial. It is encouraged to
give participants an overview of how you made your game. Talk about what
tools you used and why you chose some tools over others. Talk about what
techical challenges you faced. It would be *really* awesome if you
wanted to help others build their own games or help you make yours
better. But, it is not cool to ask people to buy your application at
CoderDojo, for that you should ask them to contact you outside of
CoderDojo.
