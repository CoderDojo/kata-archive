## Problem

Dodgy WiFi. Password seems not to work.

## Possible Solutions

\=

  - Each mentor brings a USB key, pre-loaded with any required content,
    including for Macs as well as PC.

## Actual Experience

At UCD there is excellent Wifi available without a password. The only
issue is choosing the right one from the list. UCD also has a boxfull of
promotional USB keys, but we haven't actually used those because the
wifi worked fine.

At Science Gallery the USB keys have been lifesavers at times.
