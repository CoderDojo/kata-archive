## Background Checking Ireland

In Ireland in order to ensure that volunteers are safe to work with
young people Garda Vetting is required.

The CoderDojo Foundation is now piloting Garda Vetting (January 2015)
for Irish Dojos and will be sharing all processes and documents publicly
in the near future. In the meantime if you are interested in having your
Dojo's volunteers vetted through the CoderDojo Foundation then please
feel free to email us at info@coderdojo.com.

The CoderDojo Foundation also plans to offer Child Protection Training
to Dojo volunteers in the near future. In order to avail of this
training all participants will need to be vetted through the CoderDojo
Foundation.
