## One on One Calls

Members of the CoderDojo Foundation team will be available one day
fortnightly to arrange one on one calls with CoderDojo community
members, new and old.

If you have any questions, issues or stories to tell then please feel
free to get in touch to arrange a call.

The Foundation will be setting aside the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of the
month to engage in one on one calls but if you wish to have a call and
need a time outside of these days please just let us know and we will do
what we can to arrange it.

You can arrange a call by emailing info@coderdojo.com
