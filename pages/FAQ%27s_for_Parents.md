## The Questions

  

**Is CoderDojo suitable for my child?**

  -   
    Easiest way to find out is to give it a try. Dojos vary in size,
    style of dojo - how structured or free form - and topics. Many run
    more than one room with slightly different coding activities in
    each. All dojos are free and are staffed by volunteers. Parents who
    help the dojo run, who don't need to be programmers, can make a huge
    difference to how successful the dojo is.

**What age range is CoderDojo for?**  
: CoderdDojo as a whole, approximately 6-18yrs. Individual dojos may for
example be 8-18.

**Do you teach a set course, and when does the next course start?**

  -   
    Most dojos run in such a way that children can join in at any stage.
    The structure is designed so that children can learn whether they
    are completely new or already know quite a lot. Some dojos
    experiment with running a series of dojos that progress. We are
    encouraging those dojos to say '2 of 3' on the ticket booking form
    so that parents know where in the cycle the dojo is. It may be
    perfectly OK to join in part way through even so. Many dojos have a
    mailing list where announcements about dojo dates are made. Look at
    the ticket booking page and look at past events to see how often a
    particular dojo is running.

**How big are the dojos?**  
: It varies. A few larger dojos have over 100 and run in multiple rooms.
The average size is 30. [1](http://pub.lucidpress.com/HWF2013inreview/)

**Does my child need to already know code?**  
: No. Most dojos have space for complete beginners and for children who
already know a lot. Part of the idea of CoderDojo is that children learn
how to teach themselves, by having ideas, trying things on the computer,
using online resources and by teaching each other, with mentors there to
help that happen. There should be mentors there who have a lot of
programming experience. Often that is not needed, because other children
around can help them get started.

**What does my child already need to know?**

  -   
    It's good, but not necessary, for the child to already know a bit
    about using a computer e.g. to surf the internet or write an e-mail.

**What do I need to bring?**  
: Most dojos have rules that children need parents or guardians there.
The ideal is that the parent helps the dojo run, where anything needs
doing, and it is not just tech skills that dojos need, and gets to know
other parents so that there is a community. The rule for example may be
that children under 13 need a parent at the dojo. In most dojos children
also need a laptop to program on.

**Should I get my child a new/faster laptop to participate in CoderDojo?
What kind?**

  -   
    Tablets iPad or android and chromebooks aren't suitable for learning
    programming, and notebooks with tiny screens 13" or lower will be
    frustrating. Whether it makes sense to get a new laptop depends on
    the child's interest. Most of the coding going on in Dojos does not
    need a high specced laptop with fast graphics. Refurbished laptops
    that are a few years old will work perfectly well in a dojo. We
    couldn't make recommendations about best value laptops as different
    people have different views and prices and features are constantly
    changing.

**I don't know anything about Computers. Can I help?**  
: Yes. There are many aspects of running a dojo. The more parents help
with making the dojo work well, the more time mentors have for
mentoring.

**What topics do you teach? Is there a lesson plan?**

  -   
    Dojos may teach web development, programming in Scratch, Python and
    other languages. Some dojos do electronics projects, game
    development and app development. The tools for doing this can be
    downloaded for free. How much actual teaching and how much mentoring
    and whether there is a lesson plan varies from dojo to dojo. Some of
    the resources to help learning are shared on this wiki.
