This part is so zen it has no code.

Use phpmyadmin to create tables.... lots of tables. A players table , a
weapons table, an objects table. Make sure each table has an
auto-incremental unique index. Add stats like Health and Speed and
Intelligence for the players and Durability for weapons or objects.

Now spend the next year working out how these variables and fields and
objects and arrays interact to create a game.

Use AJax and other javscript techniques to make this statistics based
world more dynamic and real-time.
