## Problem

Adults are worried that children playing games are not learning
anything?

Sub-problems:

How to convince parents that Coderdojo is worthwhile even though their
children are playing games? How to set the right values so that kids get
maximum value

## Possible Solutions

  - Encourage gamers to sit together so they can communicate about games
    and give kids more interested in listening to what the mentor has to
    say some space.
  - Recognise that playing collaborative games is extremely beneficial,
    both as a social exercise and as teaching programatic thinking.
  - Check out [this article](http://wiht.link/minecraft-in-edu) and get
    an idea of how to use Minecraft in education.
  - Spend some time with them, try out building more ambitious logic
    engines in Minecraft with them, try out modding - Java programming -
    with them. There are lots of tutorials online.

## Actual Experience

The general CoderDojo environment frequently has a distribution where
there are fresh faces every week and require more close contact with the
mentor, but often Ninjas who have been going for a while will play a lot
of Minecraft or other game. This often leads to interesting questions
about how they can modify the game to work in a new way, and mentors
must be ready to give detailed answers on how this can be achieved.

UCD CoderDojo has not encountered this issue as the kids are younger and
all enjoying doing Scratch which the adults see has direct connect to
coding and therefore doesn't worry them.

At Science Gallery CoderDojo has found some of the most able kids are
gamers. There's enthusiasm for getting behind the code of the Minecraft
game. We need to create a chain of activity focused on Minecraft
Modding.
